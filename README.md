Architecting robust, scalable, and secure systems

---



Hi, I'm Anson. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with over **5 years of experience** specializing in solution design and end-to-end application development.

My expertise lies in architecting and building scalable systems, particularly for complex, high-compliance domains like healthcare. I have a deep experience in **modern backend technologies** (like ASP.NET Core and Spring Boot), **cloud services** (both Microsoft Azure and AWS), Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms.

I hold a **Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering** from **APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University**. What I'm passionate about is using my skills to build high-impact products, which makes the world a better place.

Beyond the code and computers, I'm an avid photographer. I see both engineering and photography as forms of storytelling, one builds a narrative with code, the other with light. Both require finding order in complexity.
